\subsection{Operating System}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The prototype was installed and tested on a system running \textbf{Arch Linux}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The installation environment required the following dependencies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Go
        \item Docker
        \item Docker Compose
    \end{itemize}

    \item The above dependencies were installed using the \textbf{YAY} package manager.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation Process and Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The project documentation does not provide explicit instructions for installing the required prerequisites on the target system.

    \item After setting up the required environment the \textbf{Docker-based deployment procedure} described in the repository was followed step by step.

    \item The deployment process completed successfully and the application started correctly without any runtime errors.

    \item No missing steps broken dependencies version incompatibilities or setup inconsistencies were encountered during the installation and execution of the prototype.

    \item The only minor limitation observed concerns the lack of guidance in the documentation regarding the installation of Go Docker and Docker Compose.
\end{itemize}
